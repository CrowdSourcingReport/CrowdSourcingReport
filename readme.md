Crowdsourcing for NGOs
===

Corporate investors require frequent updates on their investment. This applies to Social Causes as well, but majority of NGOs don't have expertise to create a system that could automate this task. This causes mistrust in investors and deter small investors. This can be resolved by creating a web based interface for investors and NGOs which auto-generate daily / weekly / monthly / yearly report on development in project, based on updates posted by project manager.
Such a kind of system would also create a marketplace for NGO projects. This kind of project can be built using Google App Engine.

How is this beneficial?
---
* This project will bring accountability into transactions of NGO which will provide positive incentive for investors.
* It will increase project visibility, since it aims to create a marketplace for NGO Projects
* Project will be stored as sequence of quantifiable tasks which can be easily tracked by Investors and Project Manager. This will bring in the rigor of Industrial Project that NGO most often lack.
* Since the project will be OPEN SOURCE, it would be ever growing and have great community support.
* Biggest of all, NO SUCH SERVICE EXIST to the best of my knowledge.
